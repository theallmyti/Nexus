# Nexus

A lightweight hardware monitor for a small fleet of personal machines: Windows laptops, a Linux home server and a Raspberry Pi. A small Rust **agent** runs on each machine and reports to a **Convex** cloud backend, and a web **dashboard** shows every device live. An Android app with push alerts is planned.

**Status:** Week 1 (spikes). MVP due 3 Dec 2026.

## Why it exists

Checking temperatures, load or battery means sitting at each machine. When a machine overheats or goes offline while nobody is at home, nobody knows. Nexus puts every machine on one screen and, once alerts land, tells you when something goes wrong.

Design goals:

- **Tiny footprint.** The agent is a single headless Rust binary that sends almost nothing while nobody is watching.
- **No server to run, no ports to open.** Every connection is *outbound* to Convex, so CGNAT and blocked port forwarding don't matter.
- **Live when you look, quiet when you don't.** Per-second data flows only while someone is viewing that device, which keeps Convex usage inside the free quota.

| Layer | Tech | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Agent | Rust, Tokio, `sysinfo`, `nvml-wrapper`, Convex Rust client | Samples hardware every second, pushes live data and per-minute summaries |
| Backend | Convex (TypeScript) | Stores devices, latest snapshot and history; tracks who is watching; deletes old data |
| Dashboard | React, Vite, Convex React client | Live view of every device, plus 1 h / 6 h / 24 h history charts |
| Android app | Planned | Fleet view, pairing and push alerts (FCM) |

## How it works

### 1. Agent startup

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Start]) --> B{First argument?}
  B -- "gpu" --> G[Run as GPU helper process]
  B -- "sensors" --> S[Print sensor list and exit]
  B -- "service (Windows)" --> SV[Hand control to the<br/>Service Control Manager]
  B -- "none / config path" --> C[Load config.toml]
  SV --> C
  C -- missing or invalid --> X1([Exit with hint:<br/>copy config.example.toml])
  C --> D{device_secret set?}
  D -- no --> E[Generate a random 256-bit secret<br/>and save it to config.toml]
  D -- yes --> F
  E --> F[Hash the secret with SHA-256]
  F --> H[Open readers: CPU, RAM, disks,<br/>battery, GPU, CPU temp]
  H --> I[Connect to Convex]
  I --> J{registration_secret set?}
  J -- no --> X2([Exit: ask the other team member])
  J -- yes --> K["agent:register<br/>(name, capabilities, version)"]
  K --> L[Subscribe to agent:watchViewer]
  L --> M[[Main loop]]
```

### 2. Main loop (runs every second)

Each tick the agent takes one sample. It always feeds the per-minute summary, and it only sends the full live snapshot when someone is watching.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  T([Tick, every live_interval_secs]) --> R[Read CPU %, RAM %,<br/>CPU temp, GPU]
  R --> AG[Add sample to the aggregator]
  AG --> V{viewerUntil > now?}
  V -- yes, live --> LV[Gather extras: per-core load and clocks,<br/>RAM detail, top 5 processes,<br/>drives, uptime, battery, GPU, Docker]
  LV --> PL["agent:pushLatest<br/>(overwrites the latest row)"]
  V -- no --> FR[Free the process list]
  PL --> SD
  FR --> SD{60 s since last summary?}
  SD -- yes --> SM["Average and peak of the samples<br/>→ agent:pushSummary"]
  SD -- no --> T
  SM --> T
```

How often each reading is taken:

| Reading | While live | While idle |
|---|---|---|
| CPU %, RAM %, CPU temp | every 1 s | every 1 s (summary only) |
| GPU (NVIDIA) | every 1 s via a streaming helper | every 30 s via a one-shot helper |
| Top processes | every 5 s | not read |
| Drives | every 10 s | before each summary |
| Battery | every 10 s | every 10 s |
| Docker counts (Pi) | every 10 s | every 10 s |
| Summary push | every 60 s | every 60 s |

### 3. Live view

The dashboard tells Convex someone is watching. Convex passes that on to the agent, and the agent starts streaming. When the viewer leaves, the window expires and the agent goes quiet again on its own.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant D as Dashboard
  participant C as Convex
  participant A as Agent
  D->>C: dashboard:setViewer(deviceId) → viewerUntil = now + 30 s
  C-->>A: agent:watchViewer subscription update
  loop every 1 s while viewerUntil > now
    A->>C: agent:pushLatest (overwrite latest row)
    C-->>D: dashboard:overview subscription update
  end
  loop every 15 s while the page is open
    D->>C: dashboard:setViewer
  end
  Note over D: page closed → no more setViewer
  Note over A: viewerUntil passes → live pushes stop
```

### 4. History and retention

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Agent
  participant C as Convex
  participant Cron as Daily cron
  A->>C: agent:pushSummary (every 60 s)
  C->>C: reject if < 50 s since the last one
  C->>C: insert summaries row, update lastSeenAt
  Cron->>C: summaries:deleteOld (21:30 UTC)
  C->>C: delete rows older than 7 days, 500 at a time,<br/>rescheduling itself until done
```

A device counts as **online** when its last push is under 3 minutes old.

## Components in detail

### Agent (`agent/`)

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `main.rs` | Command-line entry, startup, registration and the main sample / live / summary loop |
| `config.rs` | Loads `config.toml`, generates and saves the device secret, SHA-256 hashing |
| `collectors.rs` | CPU per core, RAM detail, top processes, fixed drives, uptime, Raspberry Pi detection |
| `aggregator.rs` | Turns 1 s samples into a per-minute average and peak |
| `gpu.rs` | NVIDIA stats through NVML, read in a separate helper process |
| `cputemp.rs` | Windows CPU package temperature through the PawnIO driver (AMD Zen and Intel) |
| `battery.rs` | Charge, charging state, health, power draw and cycle count |
| `dashboard.rs` | Container counts from the home-server dashboard, so the agent never needs the Docker socket |
| `service.rs` | Runs as a Windows service; config and log live in `%ProgramData%\PCMonitor` |
| `logging.rs` | Logs to the terminal, or to a file that rotates at 5 MB when running as a service |

Design notes:

- **GPU in a helper process.** NVIDIA's library adds about 17 MB and can't be unloaded on Windows. The agent never loads it itself: it runs a copy of itself (`pc-monitor-agent gpu`) that streams readings while live and takes one-shot readings every 30 s while idle.
- **Windows modes.** In *no-driver* mode the agent runs as a normal user and skips CPU temperature. In *full* mode it runs as a service with the PawnIO driver and reads the CPU package temperature straight from the processor.
- **Graceful degradation.** No NVIDIA driver, no battery or no temperature sensors means that data is left out. The rest keeps running, and the agent reports what it can read as `capabilities` when it registers.

### Backend (`convex/`)

| File | Functions |
|---|---|
| `agent.ts` | `register`, `pushLatest`, `pushSummary`, `watchViewer`: called by the agent, authenticated by the device secret hash |
| `dashboard.ts` | `overview`, `history`, `setViewer`: called by the dashboard, authenticated by a read token |
| `summaries.ts` | `deleteOld`: 7-day retention in batches |
| `crons.ts` | Schedules the daily retention job |
| `schema.ts`, `validators.ts` | Table definitions and shared argument validators |

### Dashboard (`dashboard/`)

A React and Vite single-page app. After you enter the read token it shows a KPI row for the whole fleet and a section per device: live CPU, RAM, GPU, disks, battery and processes, and history charts over 1 h, 6 h or 24 h. Warning thresholds are CPU 90 °C, GPU 85 °C and RAM 90 %. See [`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md).

## Data model

```mermaid
erDiagram
  devices ||--o| latest : "has one"
  devices ||--o{ summaries : "has many (1 per minute)"

  devices {
    string name
    string secretHash "SHA-256 of device secret"
    number lastSeenAt
    number viewerUntil "live while in the future"
    number lastSummaryAt
    object capabilities
    string agentVersion
  }
  latest {
    id deviceId
    number ts
    object cpu "util, temp, per-core, clocks"
    object ram "used %, detail, top processes"
    array disks
    object gpu "optional"
    object battery "optional"
    object pi "optional, Docker counts"
  }
  summaries {
    id deviceId
    number minuteTs
    number cpuUtilAvg_Max
    number ramPctAvg_Max
    number cpuTempAvg_Max
    number gpuTempMax_UtilAvg
    number batteryPct
    array disks
  }
```

- `latest` is **overwritten** on every live push, so live data never grows storage.
- `summaries` gets **one row per device per minute** and is kept for 7 days.

## Getting started

### Agent

Requires a Rust toolchain with edition 2024 support (Rust 1.85 or newer).

```sh
cd agent
cp config.example.toml config.toml
# add registration_secret to config.toml (ask the other team member)
cargo run
```

`config.toml` settings:

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `convex_url` | yes | Convex deployment URL |
| `live_interval_secs` | yes | Seconds between samples and live pushes (default 1) |
| `registration_secret` | yes, until pairing lands | Team secret used to register a device |
| `device_secret` | no | Generated and saved on first run; never share it |
| `dashboard_url` | no (Pi only) | Home-server `/api/system` URL for Docker counts |

Other commands:

```sh
cargo run -- sensors              # list the temperature sensors this machine exposes
cargo run -- path/to/config.toml  # use a different config file
```

### Backend

```sh
cd convex
npm install
npm run dev        # push functions to the Convex deployment and watch for changes
npm run test       # Vitest
npm run typecheck
```

The backend reads `DASHBOARD_READ_TOKEN` and the registration secret from Convex environment variables.

### Dashboard

```sh
cd dashboard
npm install
VITE_CONVEX_URL=<your Convex URL> npm run dev
```

Run `npm run build` for a static build in `dist/`.

## Security

- **Device identity.** Each agent generates a random 256-bit secret on first run. Only its SHA-256 hash is sent to and stored in Convex.
- **Registration.** Until QR pairing ships, a device registers with a team secret that is shared privately and never committed.
- **Dashboard access.** Every dashboard query needs a read token checked against a Convex environment variable.
- **Rate limiting.** Convex rejects summaries sent less than 50 s apart.
- **No inbound ports.** Agents and clients only make outbound connections.
- **No Docker socket.** On the Pi, container counts come from the home-server dashboard's HTTP API instead of the root-equivalent Docker socket.
- **Never committed** (see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore)): `config.toml`, `.env*`, `*.secret`, keystores and `google-services.json`.
